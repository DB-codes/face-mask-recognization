# About Project 
The year 2020 has shown mankind some mind-boggling series of events
amongst which the COVID-19 pandemic is the most life-changing event
which has startled the world since the year began. Affecting the health
and lives of masses, COVID-19 has called for strict measures to be
followed in order to prevent the spread of disease. From the very basic
hygiene standards to the treatments in the hospitals, people are doing
all they can for their own and the society’s safety; face masks are one
of the personal protective equipment. People wear face masks once
they step out of their homes and authorities strictly ensure that people
are wearing face masks while they are in groups and public places.
To monitor that people are following this basic safety principle, a
strategy should be developed. A face mask detector system can be
implemented to check this. Face mask detection means to identify
whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The first step to recognize
the presence of a mask on the face is to detect the face, which makes
the strategy divided into two parts: to detect faces and to detect masks
on those faces. Face detection is one of the applications of object
detection and can be used in many areas like security, biometrics, law
enforcement and more. There are many detector systems developed
around the world and being implemented. However, all this science
needs optimization; a better, more precise detector, because the world
cannot afford any more increase in corona cases.
In this project, we will be developing a face mask detector that is able
to distinguish between faces with masks and faces with no masks. In
this report, we have proposed a detector USING OPEN CV AND IBM
WATSON for face detection 

# Future Scope
More than fifty countries around the world have recently initiated
wearing face masks compulsory. People have to cover their faces in
public, supermarkets, public transports, offices, and stores. Retail
companies often use software to count the number of people entering
their stores. They may also like to measure impressions on digital
displays and promotional screens. Our project can be equated to any
existing USB, IP cameras, and CCTV cameras to detect people without a
mask. Software operators can also get an image in case someone is not
wearing a mask. Furthermore, an alarm system can also be
implemented to sound a beep when someone without a mask enters
the area. This software can also be connected to the entrance gates
and only people wearing face masks can come in.

# MODULES/LIBRARIES USED
# • OPEN CV
OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop
real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image
processing, video capture and analysis including features like face
detection and object detection

# • IBM WATSON
Watson Visual Recognition makes it easy to extract thousands of
labels from your organization’s images and detect for specific
content out-of-the-box. You can also build custom models to
detect for specific content in images inside your applications.
• MYSQL CONNECTOR
MySQL Connector / ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), is
computer software from Oracle Corporation. It is an ODBC
interface and allows programming languages that support the
ODBC interface to communicate with a MySQL database.
